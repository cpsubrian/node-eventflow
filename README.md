EventFlow
=========

Flow control for your event emitters.

About
-----
EventEmitters are an important part of well-designed node.js applications.
`on()` and `emit()` can get you pretty far, but wouldn't it be great if you
could run your event handlers asynchronously, with a continuation callback?

**EventFlow** adds the flow-controlly-goodness of
[async](https://github.com/caolan/async) to your event emitters.

Usage
-----
Attach eventflow to your event emitter:

```js
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter,
    require('eventflow')(EventEmitter),
    emitter = new EventEmitter();
```

Or, if you prefer not to extend the prototype:

```js
var EventEmitter = require('events').EventEmitter,
    emitter = new EventEmitter();

require('eventflow')(emitter);
```

Listen for some events, with or without continuation callbacks. EventFlow does
some simple introspection of your listeners to see if they accept a callback
or not.

```js
emitter.on('foo', function() {
  // Do something synchronous
});

emitter.on('foo', function(callback) {
  doSomethingAsync(function(bar) {
    callback();
  });
});
```

Now use one of the flow control methods to invoke your handlers and respond
when they are done.

**series**

```js
emitter.series('foo', function() {
  // The listeners ran in the order they were added and are all finished.
});
```

**parallel**

```js
emitter.parallel('foo', function() {
  // The listeners ran in parallel and are all finished.
});
```

Advanced
--------

**Event listeners with arguments**

EventFlow supports calling your listeners with any number of arguments, as well
as the optional continuation callback.

```js
// In your logger or something:
emitter.on('purchase', function(name, item, cost) {
  console.log(name + ' just bought ' + item + ' for ' + cost);
})

// Somwhere else in your code:
emitter.on('purchase', function(name, item, cost, callback) {
  saveToDB({name: name, item: item, cost: cost}, callback);
});

// Perhaps in a form POST handler:
emitter.series('purchase', 'Brian', 'T-Shirt', '$15.00', function() {
  // The purchase was logged and saved to the db.
});
```

**Using async-style `callback(err, results)`**

EventFlow uses async directly to handle the flow-control, so you can use `err`
and `results` just like you already do.

```js
// Synchronous listeners can return a result.
emitter.on('fruit', function() {
  return 'apple';
});

// Async listeners use the standard (err, result) callback.
emitter.on('fruit', function(callback) {
  callback(null, 'orange');
});

emitter.series('fruit', function(err, results) {
  console.log(results);
  // [ 'apple', 'orange' ]
});
```

Invoke
------
EventFlow also exposes the method `emitter.invoke(event, [args...], callback)`.
Invoke executes using the following rules:

1. There must be EXACTLY one listener for the event. Otherwise the callback
   is called with an error.
2. The listener can `return` a value and if so, callback is called with `callback(err, value)`.
3. The listener can accept a continuation callback and if so, that function should
   be called with `(err, [value])`.

Think of 'invoke' as in-app RPC via an EventEmitter. Instead of passing
functions around your app in `options` objects, you can invoke them instead.

**Example**

```js
emitter.on('add', function(a, b) {
  return a + b;
});
emitter.invoke('add', 1, 2, function(err, value) {
  console.log(value);
  // 3
});


emitter.on('subtract', function(a, b, callback) {
  callback(null, a - b);
});
emitter.invoke('subtract', 3, 2, function(err, value) {
  console.log(value);
  // 1
});
```

Waterfall
---------

The waterfall method allows listeners to modify a variable in a series. The
first listener receives an initial value, and each subsequent listener modifies
the return of the last listener:

```js
emitter.on('foo', function(n) {
  // sync task
  return n + 1;
});
emitter.on('foo', function(n, callback) {
  // async task
  cb(null, n * 3);
});
emitter.waterfall('foo', 2, function(err, n) {
  // n = 9
});
```
